Privacy Policy for Snap to YouTube
Effective date: June 25, 2025

Snap to YouTube ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension that allows users to capture and analyze screen content to find related YouTube videos.

This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and how your privacy is protected.

Information We Collect
We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate the extension:

1. User Activity (Snip Count)
We locally store how many snips a user has taken.

This is used to enforce the free trial limit (10 snips).

This information is not transmitted off your device.

2. Screenshot Data
When you perform a snip, a screenshot of your visible tab is captured.

The image is temporarily uploaded to a secure cloud hosting provider in order to:

Run a reverse image search

Analyze the image using an AI model

Generate relevant YouTube video recommendations

The image is not stored permanently and is not linked to your identity.

3. ExtensionPay Integration
We use ExtensionPay to handle payments and subscriptions.

Your email address and payment details are handled by ExtensionPay and Stripe.

We do not store or access your personal payment information.

Data We Do Not Collect
We do not collect, store, or access:

Personally identifiable information (name, address, email, etc.)

Browsing history

Passwords or authentication information

Location or IP address

Health or financial data

Chat logs, keystrokes, or user communications

How We Use Data
The limited data collected is used solely for:

Enabling core functionality of the extension (screenshot analysis)

Enforcing free trial usage

Displaying YouTube content relevant to your screenshots

Supporting paid subscriptions via ExtensionPay

We do not use or transfer user data for advertising, analytics, or profiling.
We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

Third-Party Services
